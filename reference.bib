abstract = "A novel approach for the readout of a \{TPC\} at the future linear collider is to use a \{CMOS\} pixel detector combined with some kind of gas gain grid. A first test using the photon counting chip Medipix2 with \{GEM\} or Micromegas demonstrated the feasibility of such an approach. Although this experiment demonstrated that single primary electrons could be detected the chip did not provide information on the arrival time of the electron in the sensitive gas volume nor did it give any indication of the quantity of charge detected. The Timepix chip uses an external clock with a frequency of up to 100 \{MHz\} as a time reference. Each pixel contains a preamplifier, a discriminator with hysteresis and 4-bit \{DAC\} for threshold adjustment, synchronization logic and a 14-bit counter with overflow control. Moreover, each pixel can be independently configured in one of four different modes: masked mode: pixel is off, counting mode: 1-count for each signal over threshold, \{TOT\} mode: the counter is incremented continuously as long as the signal is above threshold, and arrival time mode: the counter is incremented continuously from the time the first hit arrives until the end of the shutter. The chip resembles very much the Medipix2 chip physically and can be readout using slightly modified versions of the various existing systems. This paper presents the main features of the new design, electrical measurements and some first images. "

  abstract={The Timepix3, hybrid pixel detector (HPD) readout chip, a successor to the Timepix \cite{timepix2007} chip, can record time-of-arrival (ToA) and time-over-threshold (ToT) simultaneously in each pixel. ToA information is recorded in a 14-bit register at 40 MHz and can be refined by a further 4 bits with a nominal resolution of 1.5625 ns (640 MHz). ToT is recorded in a 10-bit overflow controlled counter at 40 MHz. Pixels can be programmed to record 14 bits of integral ToT and 10 bits of event counting, both at 40 MHz. The chip is designed in 130 nm CMOS and contains 256 × 256 pixel channels (55 × 55 μm 2 ). The chip, which has more than 170 M transistors, has been conceived as a general-purpose readout chip for HPDs used in a wide range of applications. Common requirements of these applications are operation without a trigger signal, and sparse readout where only pixels containing event information are read out. A new architecture has been designed for sparse readout and can achieve a throughput of up to 40 Mhits/s/cm 2 . The flexible architecture offers readout schemes ranging from serial (one link) readout (40 Mbps) to faster parallel (up to 8 links) readout of 5.12 Gbps. In the ToA/ToT operation mode, readout is simultaneous with data acquisition thus keeping pixels sensitive at all times. The pixel matrix is formed by super pixel (SP) structures of 2 × 4 pixels. This optimizes resources by sharing the pixel readout logic which transports data from SPs to End-of-Column (EoC) using a 2-phase handshake protocol. To reduce power consumption in applications with a low duty cycle, an on-chip power pulsing scheme has been implemented. The logic switches bias currents of the analog front-ends in a sequential manner, and all front-ends can be switched in 800 ns. The digital design uses a mixture of commercial and custom standard cell libraries and was verified using Open Verification Methodology (OVM) and commercial timing analysis tools. The analog front-end and a voltage-controlled oscillator for 1.5625 ns timing resolution have been designed using full custom techniques.}

abstract = "The semiconductor pixel detector Timepix (256×256 pixels with pitch of 55 μm) is a successor of the Medipix2 device. Each Timepix pixel can be independently operated in one of three possible modes: (1) counting of the detected particles; (2) measurement of the particle energy; and (3) measurement of the time of interaction. The energy measurement in the second mode is performed via the determination of the “time-over-threshold” (TOT). The energy measurement with the Timepix detector in \{TOT\} mode requires knowledge of the energy calibration of each pixel of the matrix. Such calibration is very nonlinear in the low energy range and can be described by a surrogate function depending on four parameters. The determination of all these parameters can be performed by measurement and evaluation of the response of each pixel in at least four calibration points. The procedure is extremely demanding: it requires the analysis of at least 250 thousand spectra and the performance of 330 thousand least-squares fits. In this article, it is demonstrated that even better result can be achieved with only two or three calibration points halving the number of least-squares fits needed. The method is based on precise analysis of the shape of spectral peaks. The article also discusses the performance of energy calibrated device for spectrometry of heavy charged particles. "

This makes them suitable for various applications such as radiography, neutronography, micro-tomography and X-ray dynamic defectoscopy. In order to control and manage such complex measurements a multi-platform software package for acquisition and data processing with a Java graphical user interface has been developed. The functionality of the original version of Pixelman package has been upgraded and extended to include the new medipix devices. The software package can be run on Microsoft Windows, Linux and Mac OS X operating systems. The architecture is very flexible and the functionality can be extended by plugins in C++, Java or combinations of both. The software package may be used as a distributed acquisition system using computers with different operating systems over a local network or the Internet.}

  abstract={The ATLAS-MPX detectors are based on Medipix2 silicon devices designed by CERN for the detection of different types of radiation. These detectors are covered with converting layers of 6 LiF and polyethylene (PE) to increase their sensitivity to thermal and fast neutrons, respectively. These devices allow the measurement of the composition and spectroscopic characteristics of the radiation field in ATLAS, particularly of neutrons. These detectors can operate in low or high preset energy threshold mode. The signature of particles interacting in a ATLAS-MPX detector at low threshold are clusters of adjacent pixels with different size and form depending on their type, energy and incidence angle. The classification of particles into different categories can be done using the geometrical parameters of these clusters. The Medipix analysis framework (MAFalda) — based on the ROOT application — allows the recognition of particle tracks left in ATLAS-MPX devices located at various positions in the ATLAS detector and cavern. The pattern recognition obtained from the application of MAFalda was configured to distinguish the response of neutrons from other radiation. The neutron response at low threshold is characterized by clusters of adjoining pixels (heavy tracks and heavy blobs) left by protons and heavy ions resulting from neutron interactions in the converting layers of the ATLAS-MPX devices. The neutron detection efficiency of ATLAS-MPX devices has been determined by the exposure of two detectors of reference to radionuclide sources of neutrons ( 252 Cf and 241 AmBe). With these results, an estimate of the neutrons fields produced at the devices locations during ATLAS operation was done.}

  abstract={The semiconductor pixel detector Timepix contains an array of 256 × 256 square pixels with pitch 55 μm. In addition to high spatial granularity the single quantum counting detector Timepix can provide also energy or time information in each pixel. This device is a powerful tool for radiation and particle detection, imaging and tracking. A new readout interface for silicon pixel detectors of the Medipix family has been developed in our group in order to provide a higher frame rate and enhanced flexibility of operation. The interface consists of a field programmable gate array, a USB 2.0 interface chip, DAC, ADC and a circuit which generates bias voltage for the sensor. The main control system is placed in the FPGA circuit which fully controls the Timepix device. This approach offers an easy way how to include new functionality and extended operation. The interface for Timepix supports all operation modes of the detector (counting, TOT, timing). The FITPix is a successor of the USB 1.22 Interface and the electronic readout is built with the latest available components, which allows achieving up to 90 frames per second with a single detector. The frame rate is about 20 times faster compared to the previous system while it maintains all same capabilities supported. In addition FITPix newly enables an adjustable clock frequency and hardware triggering which is a useful tool when there is the need for synchronized operation of multiple devices. Three modes of hardware trigger have been implemented: hardware trigger which starts the measurement, hardware trigger which terminates the measurement and hardware trigger which controls measurement fully. The entire system is fully powered through the USB bus. FITPix supports also readout from several detectors in chain in which case just an external power source is required. FITPix is a fully flexible device and the user needs no other equipment. FITPix combines high performance and mobility and it opens new fields of applications. The current version of the FITPix interface has dimension 45 mm × 60 mm.}

Each Timepix pixel can be operated in Time-over-Threshold mode allowing direct energy measurement. The possibility of per pixel energy measurement presents a substantial advantage for X-ray radiography with polychromatic X-ray sources (tubes) allowing material identification (colour X-ray radiography) via analysis of transmission energy spectra. The energy resolution of the pixelated planar detector is, however, influenced by charge sharing. The ionization charge generated by the particle (X-ray photon) can be collected by several pixels, forming a cluster. If the fraction of the charge collected by a particular pixel drops below the energy threshold it is not counted and therefore it is lost. This fact, together with the presence of noise, limits the energy resolution of the device. A simplified model of the charge sharing effect is studied in this work and compared with experimental data. The application of a (per-pixel) energy-calibrated TimePix detector in the field of energy-sensitive X-ray radiography enables the recognition of soft biological materials (fat and muscle tissue) which is presented here.

  abstract={Semiconductor detector readout chips with pulse processing electronics have made possible spectroscopic X-ray imaging, bringing an improvement in the overall image quality and, in the case of medical imaging, a reduction in the X-ray dose delivered to the patient. In this contribution we review the state of the art in semiconductor-detector readout ASICs for spectroscopic X-ray imaging with emphasis on hybrid pixel detector technology. We discuss how some of the key challenges of the technology (such as dealing with high fluxes, maintaining spectral fidelity, power consumption density) are addressed by the various ASICs. In order to understand the fundamental limits of the technology, the physics of the interaction of radiation with the semiconductor detector and the process of signal induction in the input electrodes of the readout circuit are described. Simulations of the process of signal induction are presented that reveal the importance of making use of the small pixel effect to minimize the impact of the slow motion of holes and hole trapping in the induced signal in high-Z sensor materials. This can contribute to preserve fidelity in the measured spectrum with relatively short values of the shaper peaking time. Simulations also show, on the other hand, the distortion in the energy spectrum due to charge sharing and fluorescence photons when the pixel pitch is decreased. However, using recent measurements from the Medipix3 ASIC, we demonstrate that the spectroscopic information contained in the incoming photon beam can be recovered by the implementation in hardware of an algorithm whereby the signal from a single photon is reconstructed and allocated to the pixel with the largest deposition.}

The detector will respond differently for different types of radiation. If the acquisition time is short enough with respect to radiation intensity, one can see characteristic tracks of individual quanta in an image taken (e.g., curved lines for electrons, round shaped clusters for alpha particles, heavy ions and slow neutrons, cone shapes for fast neutrons, simple dots for low energy X-rays, etc.). For effective visualization of neutrons, the device has to be equipped by corresponding neutron converter, which converts neutrons to heavy charged particles. By analyzing these patterns, in this so-called âtracking modeâ of operation, it is possible to distinguish individual tracks and classify them into predefined categories. For each âclusterâ detected, the features (such as parameters describing the shape and energy deposition estimation) can be extracted and used to distinguish radiation type. The energy deposited can be estimated by using calibration measurements with different types of radiation and variation of the discrimination threshold. "
